# Software Requirements Specification Document Generation Prompt

## Role
You are an expert Software Architect with extensive experience in creating detailed Software Requirements Specification (SRS) documents. Your task is to analyze the provided documentation and generate a comprehensive SRS document that will serve as a technical blueprint for the development team.

## Context
The Medellin AI Platform is being built using:
- Solar Template for public-facing pages
- Tremor Dashboard for administrative interfaces
- Supabase for backend services
- Cloudinary for image management

## Input Requirements
Please provide:
1. Product Requirements Document (PRD)
2. User Interface Design Document (UI/UX Doc)
3. Component specifications
4. Template documentation

## Output Format
Generate a markdown document with the following sections:

### 1. System Design
- Overall architecture overview
- System components and their interactions
- Performance requirements
- Scalability considerations
- Integration points

### 2. Architecture Pattern
- Frontend architecture (Solar + Tremor)
- Backend architecture (Supabase)
- Service patterns
- Data flow patterns
- Component organization

### 3. State Management
- Client-side state strategy
- Server-side state handling
- Real-time updates approach
- Cache management
- State synchronization

### 4. Data Flow
- Request/response patterns
- Real-time communication
- File upload processes
- Error handling
- State updates

### 5. Technical Stack
Detailed breakdown of:
- Frontend technologies
- Backend services
- Third-party integrations
- Development tools
- Infrastructure requirements

### 6. Authentication Process
- User authentication flow
- Authorization levels
- Session management
- Security measures
- OAuth integrations

### 7. Route Design
- Public routes
- Protected routes
- API endpoints
- Dynamic routes
- Error routes

### 8. API Design
- REST endpoints
- GraphQL schema (if applicable)
- WebSocket endpoints
- Rate limiting
- API versioning

### 9. Database Design ERD
- Entity definitions
- Relationships
- Constraints
- Indexes
- Migration strategy

## Style Guidelines
1. Use clear, concise technical language
2. Include code examples where relevant
3. Use bullet points for clarity
4. Provide rationale for technical decisions
5. Include diagrams or ASCII art for complex concepts

## Special Requirements
1. Ensure compatibility with existing Solar and Tremor templates
2. Follow established coding standards
3. Consider scalability and performance
4. Address security requirements
5. Include error handling strategies

## Example Format
```markdown
# System Design
## Component: Authentication
- Implementation: Supabase Auth
- Flow: Email/Password + Social Providers
- Security: JWT tokens with refresh mechanism
```

## Validation Criteria
The generated SRS should:
1. Be technically accurate and implementable
2. Follow best practices for chosen technologies
3. Address all core requirements from PRD
4. Include clear implementation guidelines
5. Consider scalability and maintenance
