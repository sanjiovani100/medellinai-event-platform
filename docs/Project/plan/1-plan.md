## Vercel Deployment Troubleshooting

### Common 404 NOT_FOUND Errors

When deploying to Vercel, 404 NOT_FOUND errors can occur for several reasons. Here's a systematic approach to diagnose and fix these issues:

#### 1. Deployment Failed or Not Completed

- **Diagnosis**:
  - Check Vercel Dashboard → Select project → Deployments
  - Look for build errors or failed deployments
- **Solution**:
  - Fix any build errors in the logs
  - Ensure all dependencies are properly installed
  - Verify build command is correct

#### 2. Missing Entry Files

- **Diagnosis**:
  - Vercel requires proper entry files to serve the project
  - For Next.js App Router: Verify `app/page.tsx` exists
  - For Next.js Pages Router: Verify `pages/index.js` exists
  - For static sites: Verify `public/index.html` exists
- **Solution**:
  - Create the appropriate entry file if missing
  - Verify the build output contains the necessary files:
    ```bash
    ls -la .next
    ```
  - Rebuild if necessary:
    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```

#### 3. Routing Configuration Issues

- **Diagnosis**:
  - Check for proper routing setup in Next.js
  - Verify `vercel.json` configuration if present
- **Solution**:
  - For App Router: Ensure proper directory structure with `app/page.tsx`
  - For dynamic routes: Add `not-found.tsx` page inside `app/`
  - Create or update `vercel.json` with proper routing rules:
    ```json
    {
      "version": 2,
      "buildCommand": "npm run build",
      "outputDirectory": ".next",
      "framework": "nextjs",
      "routes": [{ "src": "/(.*)", "dest": "/" }]
    }
    ```

#### 4. Build Configuration Issues

- **Diagnosis**:
  - Check Vercel project settings for correct build configuration
- **Solution**:
  - Verify Build Command: `npm run build` for Next.js
  - Verify Output Directory: `.next` for Next.js
  - Ensure environment variables are properly set
  - Update `next.config.js` with proper Vercel compatibility settings:
    ```javascript
    const nextConfig = {
      output: "standalone",
      reactStrictMode: true,
      // Other settings...
    };
    ```

#### 5. Domain Configuration Issues

- **Diagnosis**:
  - Check if the deployment is accessible but the domain shows 404
- **Solution**:
  - Go to Vercel Dashboard → Settings → Domains
  - Ensure domain is properly linked and DNS is configured
  - Check for "Not Found" status and resolve domain issues

#### 6. Cache Issues

- **Diagnosis**:
  - Deployment succeeded but still showing old content or 404
- **Solution**:
  - Force a new deployment:
    ```bash
    vercel --prod --force
    ```
  - Or use Vercel Dashboard → Deployments → Redeploy
  - Clear browser cache or try in incognito mode

### Implementation Checklist for Vercel Deployment

- [ ] Ensure all required dependencies are in package.json
- [ ] Create proper entry files (app/page.tsx or pages/index.js)
- [ ] Configure environment variables in Vercel dashboard

## Documentation Best Practices

To ensure efficient and effective documentation throughout the project, follow these rules:

1. **Plan the document structure first**

   - Outline key sections before writing
   - Identify the purpose and audience
   - Determine appropriate level of detail

2. **Focus on essential information without excessive code examples**

   - Include only necessary code snippets
   - Use bullet points and concise descriptions
   - Prioritize actionable information over exhaustive details

3. **Create a concise, actionable document from the start**

   - Write clear, direct instructions
   - Use task-oriented language
   - Include specific, measurable outcomes

4. **Avoid multiple iterations that waste tokens**

   - Get it right the first time
   - Review thoroughly before submitting
   - Update only when substantial changes are needed

5. **Use cost-effective models for planning tasks**
   - Model cost comparison for planning tasks:
     - OpenAI o3 mini: Use for all planning and architecture tasks
     - GPT-4o: More expensive alternative
     - Claude 3.7 Sonnet: Most expensive option
   - OpenAI o3 mini provides the best balance of capability and cost-efficiency for planning tasks
   - Reserve more expensive models for tasks requiring their specific capabilities
   - Consider token usage and efficiency in model selection
