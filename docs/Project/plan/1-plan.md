## Documentation Best Practices

To ensure efficient and effective documentation throughout the project, follow these rules:

1. **Plan the document structure first**

   - Outline key sections before writing
   - Identify the purpose and audience
   - Determine appropriate level of detail

2. **Focus on essential information without excessive code examples**

   - Include only necessary code snippets
   - Use bullet points and concise descriptions
   - Prioritize actionable information over exhaustive details

3. **Create a concise, actionable document from the start**

   - Write clear, direct instructions
   - Use task-oriented language
   - Include specific, measurable outcomes

4. **Avoid multiple iterations that waste tokens**

   - Get it right the first time
   - Review thoroughly before submitting
   - Update only when substantial changes are needed

5. **Use cost-effective models for planning tasks**
   - Model cost comparison for planning tasks:
     - OpenAI o3 mini: Use for all planning and architecture tasks
     - GPT-4o: More expensive alternative
     - Claude 3.7 Sonnet: Most expensive option
   - OpenAI o3 mini provides the best balance of capability and cost-efficiency for planning tasks
   - Reserve more expensive models for tasks requiring their specific capabilities
   - Consider token usage and efficiency in model selection
