Act as an expert UI/UX designer specializing in high-conversion CTAs. Redesign the call-to-action section for optimal engagement by integrating content seamlessly into a clean, visually appealing layout. Remove bullet points and ensure the design naturally guides users toward the existing action buttons without additional text prompts like 'Join Now' or 'Explore Events.' Maintain a strong visual hierarchy, ensuring clarity and professional appeal. Provide structured recommendations, including a layout breakdown or wireframe-style guidance."
